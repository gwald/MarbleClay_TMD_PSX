DOSBOX is very slow and hacky, but seems to work.
As a (better) alternative ntvdmx64-ccpu-fre_ver.07.04.2023-eng.zip is here for the few DOS programs required for PSX format conversion.
Because the PlayStation 3D creation tools are DOS executables they require ntvdmx64 (https://mendelson.org/ntvdmx64.html) to run.
Anti virus think this is a virus, it's not and works great, it's like dosbox but native DOS support.
It also fixes the issue with MekaHelp.exe

.7z files are source code for the plugins and tmdanim is an PSX animation TMD packer.
