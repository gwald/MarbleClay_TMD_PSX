Download the latest version and extract to C:\MarbleClay

Extract the content of the zip file over the existing files.
Read the included .txt files for more information.
The script files are there mostly as examples and the qtest.lua (quad coplanar test) is useful.
The Sample folder contains older sample files.
The source code is very hacky mess and not great!
